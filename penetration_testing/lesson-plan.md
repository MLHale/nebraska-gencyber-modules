title: Penetration testing
---

### Summary
Web servers are constantly bombarded with attacks. This lesson explores how developers can get ahead of attackers and test their web apps to identify vulnerabilities.

### Grade
10-11

### Time Required
2 Hours

### First principles
- [ ] Domain Separation
- [ ] Process Isolation
- [x] Resource Encapsulation
- [ ] Modularity
- [x] Least Privilege
- [ ] Abstraction
- [x] Data Hiding
- [x] Layering
- [ ] Simplicity
- [x] Minimization

### Learning Objectives

1. Students will be able to use a REST Client to make malicious POST and GET requests to an API
2. Students will be able to identify and understand basic software testing paradigms
3. Students will be able to identify software weaknesses in API endpoints
4. Students will be able to trace exploit weaknesses to identify vulnerabilities
5. Students will be able to conduct a risk assessment

### Materials list

* PC
* Internet connection
* Little bits cloud bit and API Key
* Little bits acuator (of any kind) e.g. an led

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Introduce the concept of a risk landscape and attack surface. 

#### Focused Activity
Students will use POSTMAN to send a simple requests to the server and see if the api has enforced authentication and permissions.
Students will explore all the api endpoints.

#### Closure
Talk about how risks exist in any context, but we can learn more about them and prioritize accordingly to mitigate the most risky ones.

#### Reflection
Think back to other REST lessons to emphasize the importance of security in design

### Assessment

1. Walk Around
2. Oral Questioning
3. Successful GET/POST requests 

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

N/A

### Extension Activity (ies)

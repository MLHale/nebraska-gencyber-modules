### Learning Objectives

1. Student will be able to define 'REST', 'a REST endpoint', 'API Integration', and 'API Invocation'
1. Student will be able use a REST Client to make POST and GET requests to an API
1. Student will be able to make an API mashup using API data.
1. Student will understand and identify related cybersecurity first principles.

### Materials list

* PC
* Internet connection
* Little bits cloud bit and API Key
* Little bits sensor and actuator

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by using paper and post it notes to get a physical conception of a REST API.

#### Focused Activity
Students will use POSTMAN rest client to connect to the little bits api and make GET and POST requests.

#### Closure
Students will make a mashup to signal the little bits api to light up an LED using a restful request.

#### Reflection
Students will review relevant first principles learned through though lesson. A small kahoots (or similar) quiz will be given

### Assessment

1. Walk Around
1. Oral Questioning
1. Quiz (Kahootz)

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

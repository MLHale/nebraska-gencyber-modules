# Intro to Components using Littlebits Droids

### Summary
This is a module about modules. It introduces component-based thinking using modular components in the `Littlebits Droid Kit (TM)`.

### Grade
6-10

### Time Required
1-2 hours

### First principles
- [ ] Domain Separation
- [ ] Process Isolation
- [ ] Resource Encapsulation
- [x] Modularity
- [ ] Least Privilege
- [x] Abstraction
- [ ] Data Hiding
- [ ] Layering
- [x] Simplicity
- [ ] Minimization

### Learning Objectives

1. Student will be able to use input and output modules to assemble a larger design.
2. Student will understand the benefits of modularity.
3. Student will be able to conceptualize and decompose a problem into smaller sub-problems.

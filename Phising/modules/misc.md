#Answer Key

## Reading a URL
#### Exercise:

##### What are the top-level domain names for these URLs:

```
http://www.cnn.com/tiger-woods/story.html   
http://www.buy.com.money.ru
```

Answer:

1. `cnn.com`
2. `money.ru` (Phishing site, not affiliated with buy.com)


##### Which link will you click on? #1 or #2

1. `ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/software/patches/fixit.exe`
2. `http://www.micosoft.com/software/patches/fixit.exe`

Answer:  
If you answered #2 then you fell prey to a phishing attack! Notice the typo in the domain name for link #2. Spammers often register domain names with common typos for popular domain names. This is called "Typo-squatting".

For #1, ftp:// is a just a different protocol than http. Otherwise, it is a legitimate `microsoft.com` domain resource.

- **Algorithm** - a step-by-step set of instructions to accomplish a task or solve a problem. Written in human instructions.
- **Program** - A list of steps that tell a computer how to complete a task.
- **Bug** - An error in a line of code that causes the program to not run.
- **Debugging** - The process of identifying bugs (errors) in a program.



### Logic Unplugged Activity
- Understanding logic is an important step in programming
- Our goal during this lesson is to instruct a “robot” to stack cups in a certain design.
- Robots in Action 
- How do you think these robots know how to dance?

Let’s try an activity! 
### Logic Unplugged Activity-Rules
- **Pick up** cup means that the cup automatically goes up as high as it needs to.
- **Put down** cup means that it automatically goes down until it lands on something.
  - The hand automatically returns to cup stack after setting down a cup.
- **Step forward** means the robot moves one step (1/2 cup width) forward.
- **Step backward** means the robot moves one step (1/2 cup width) backward.

- Programmers are **not** allowed to talk when the robot is working. 
    - This includes blurting out answers or pointing out when the robot has done something wrong.
- Programmers should raise their hand if they see a bug.

### Logic Unplugged Activity-Materials
You will need:
- A partner - One person is the **Programmer** and the other person is the **Robot**.
- You can use a cup spacing mat if you need to
- Depending on the design, you will need 2-5 cups per “pair”

### Logic Unplugged - Your Turn!
- Now try it on your own! 
- Get into your groups and pick one of these designs. 
- Make sure you also write down your “program” using the symbols in your workbook

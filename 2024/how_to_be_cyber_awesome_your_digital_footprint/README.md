title: How to be Cyber Awesome: Your Digital Footprint
---

### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Defense in Depth__: Using multiple layers of protection to secure something.
* __Keep it Simple__: Avoid unnecessary complexity and reduce exposed areas.
* __Think Like an Adversary__: Be proactive by thinking of what an attacker can exploit (weaknesses and vulnerabilities).
* __Confidentiality__: Define permissions for interactions with protected objects.

### Introduction
In this lesson, we will learn how components can be used to solve a problem by decomposing it into sub-problems. We will also learn about how the `design process` can be applied to imagine a problem, think about different solutions, and then iteratively make attempts to solve it - getting better solutions at each iteration.

### What is a Digital Footprint?

* A Digital Footprint is information about a particular person that exists on the Internet as a result of their online activity.
* Everything you do online leaves a trail back to who you are as a digital technology user.
* Every device that connects to the Internet has an Internet Protocol Address (IP address). 

### IP Addresses and Your Digital Footprint

* An IP address is a unique set of numbers for every device (laptop, cell phone, gaming console, etc.) that connects to the Internet.
* An IP address identifies your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and your approximate location. 
* Your IP Address for your device is logged on website servers around the world, tracking the device activity.
* Every web search that you do on Google is logged by the Google web server. 
* Every video you watch on YouTube is logged by the YouTube web server.
* Every game you play online is logged on that games web server.
* All of this activity makes up your Digital Footprint.

### Good for your Digital Footprint

- Appropriate photos that reflect a positive image.
  - Things you’ve done at school, with clubs, with sport teams, and community service.
- Positive comments made by you or comments made by others about you.
  - Recognition that you received an award or you posting a nice comment on a friends picture.

### Harmful for your Digital Footprint

- Inappropriate photos or comments
- Photos, videos, or comments that reference illegal behavior.
- Personal and private information that you don’t want others to know.

### Tips for keeping a Good Digital Footprint

- Think long term. Future employers or college admissions will look at your Digital Footprint when making a decision to hire you or give you a scholarship.
- Think about what your family might think of your Digital Footprint. Would your parents, grandparents, or siblings approve of your Digital Footprint?
- Don’t overshare your personal information online. Be careful about what you share online. Don’t share your private information online, such as your address, phone numbers, or birth date. 
- Use the the THINK acronym before posting anything online.
  - Is it TRUE?
  - Is it HELPFUL?
  - Is it IMPORTANT?
  - Is it NECESSARY?
  - Is it KIND?

title: How to be Cyber Awesome - Password Security
---

### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Defense in Depth__: Using multiple layers of protection to secure something.
* __Keep it Simple__: Avoid unnecessary complexity and reduce exposed areas.
* __Think Like an Adversary__: Be proactive by thinking of what an attacker can exploit (weaknesses and vulnerabilities).
* __Confidentiality__: Define permissions for interactions with protected objects.

### Authentication
- Authentication is the process of verifying that you are who you say you are. 
- Example: username, password, email.

### Single, Two, Multi-factor Authentication
- Something you know: includes your username and password.
- Something you have: ID badge, cell phone text message with a code/pin
- Something you are: your fingerprint, retina (eye) scan
- Multi-factor is the process of choosing two or more of these factors

Passwords are the most common form of authentication used by websites.
What makes a good password?


### Strong Passwords may contain
- At least eight charactersâ€”the more characters, the better.
- A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- A mixture of letters and numbers.
- Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]


### Weak Passwords may contain
- Fewer than eight characters. 
- Includes words found in the dictionary.
- Includes personal identifiable information, such as name, pets names, birthday, etc.


### How can someone figure out your password?
Based on how many characters a password includes, if the characters are letters, numbers, or special characters, someone can figure out how many possible passwords there could be.


## Activity
### Creating Your Own Password Generator
You will be create a password generator using your Microbits. 
A couple of things first:
We will be using variables and functions. 

**Functions:** are used to make a portion of code do a similar task multiple times. 

**Variables:** a variable is something that can be changed. We use variables in coding to store information that may change or may need to be used later.

title: Introduction to Microbits
---


### Introduction
Microbits are pocket-sized computers designed to make learning and teaching easy and fun. They are equipped with various sensors and inputs, allowing users to create and program a wide range of interactive projects.

### Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
* understand the basic components and features of the Microbit including its LED display, buttons, and sensors.
* create simple programs using block-based coding to control the Microbit and interact with its various components through hands-on activities and challenges.


### Materials Required

* Microbit
* USB cord
* Battery Holder
* 2 AAA batteries for the battery holder
* Microbit Smart Watch Kit

### Prerequisite lessons
None

### What is a Microbit?

- A pocket-sized computer that can be programmed.
- Has all these things that can be programmed:
  - 25 red LED lights
  - 3 programmable buttons
  - An accelerometer so it can detect motion
  - A built-in compass
  - A microphone
  - A speaker
  - Connector for accessories

### Task 1: Attaching the Battery Pack to the Microbit
- Unpackage your batteries and put them in your battery holder.
- Plug the battery pack into the Microbit. Check for the RED light on the back of the Microbit.
- The Microbit might start making noise.
- Wiggle the white part of the battery pack to detach it from the Microbit.

### Task 2: Attaching the USB Cord to the Microbit
- Untie the twist tie on the cord. 
- Plug the cord into the Microbit.
- Plug the USB end into the Chromebook. Check for the RED light on the back of the Microbit.
- Make sure the Microbit Icon appears on the computer screen.

### USB Cord or Battery Pack?

#### USB Cord
- When coding your Microbit on the MakeCode website, you only need to attach the USB cord to the Microbit. 
- The Chromebook will supply power to the Microbit.
  
#### Battery Pack
- Only use when you want your Microbit to be mobile and not connected to the Chrombook. 
- After the code has been downloaded to the Microbit from the MakeCode website, BEFORE unplugging the USB cord, plug the battery pack into the Microbit.


### Task 3: What is Pair Programming?
- Pair programming is where two programmers work together at one workstation/computer. 
- One person is the driver, types the code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. 
- The two programmers **switch roles frequently**.

### Time Required
2 hours 15 minutes

### Cybersecurity Concepts
- [ ] Defense in Depth
- [x] Confidentiality 
- [ ] Integrity
- [ ] Availability
- [ ] Think Like an Adversary

### Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to understand the importance of confidentiality and its role in protecting sensitive information.    
* Students will be to able to implement strategies and best practices to maintain confidentiality in various scenarios through hands-on activities and real-world examples.


### Materials list
Micorbits

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will brainstorm information typically found in a classroom setting. They then categorize this information as either confidential or non confidential.


#### Focused Activity
Students will participate in a collaborative activity to compute average ratings without revealing individual scores. This demonstrates how data can be aggregated while maintaining confidentiality.
Students will code a Caesar Cipher program on Microbits, encrypting and decrypting messages using buttons and tilting gestures.

#### Closure

Review what was discussed in the module.

#### Reflection

Students will consider the importance of confidentiality in their own lives and explore additional cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data.

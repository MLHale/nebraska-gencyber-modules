### Sample Problems
- You hear a hissing noise from underneath your sink and find out the water tank has a crack in it.
- You noticed something posted on your SnapChat account that you didn’t post.
- You bend over and your pants split open.
- You’re in the middle of a game and the internet goes out.


### Ways to Approach Problems
We are face with problems each and every day. Some problems are smaller than others. Some problems can be solved quickly and others require multiple attempts. There are many different approaches to solving problems.

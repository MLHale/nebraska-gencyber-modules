### Let's Brainstorm First!

- List 1-2 things that are okay to share online?
- List 1-2 things you should not share online?

### Personal Information VS Private Information
- Personal Information
  - Information about you that cannot be used to identify you because it is also true for many other people (e.g., your hair color or the city you live in).
- Private Information
  - Information about you that can be used to identify you because it's unique to you (e.g., your full name or your address).

### Personal or Private?

- In your notes, there is a list of Personal and Private Examples.
- Circle if you think the examples are personal or private information. 
  - To help you decide, ask, "Would this information also be true for many other people?" If so, it's personal. If not, it's private.

### How Could Sharing Private Information Online be Unsafe?

- Sharing private information can affect your online privacy and could make you the target of cyber crimes.
- Posting private information about you could make it easier for cyber criminals to learn information about you to commit cyber crimes.

### “Oversharing” Personal Information Online 

- It’s okay to share some personal information online, but be careful of “Oversharing.”
- “Oversharing” is sharing an excessive amount of personal and private information online, especially in a way which might be considered inappropriate or dangerous to you and those around you.

### Tips for Preventing Oversharing

#### What you post is a reflection of who you are.
- Imagine that the mirror is attached to your computer/device. It you look in it and saw someone in the reflection (parents, employer, coach), would they approve of what they’re doing or saying online?

#### Remember to “Keep it Clean & True” and only post appropriate things.
- Too many times people are posting information that is NOT appropriate or information that is not true (rumors).

#### Lock down your privacy settings.
- Remember to set privacy settings on all your accounts so that your information is secure.

#### Everything that you put online is permanent.
- Even if you hit the delete button after posting. Remember to THINK before you post.

#### You wouldn’t share your toothbrush with anyone. 
- Don’t share your private information online.

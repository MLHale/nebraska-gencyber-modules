title: How to be Cyber Awesome - Ethical AI
---

### Cybersecurity Concepts in this lesson

* __Defense in Depth__: Using multiple layers of protection to secure something.
* __Keep it Simple__: Avoid unnecessary complexity and reduce exposed areas.
* __Think Like an Adversary__: Be proactive by thinking of what an attacker can exploit (weaknesses and vulnerabilities).
* __Confidentiality__: Define permissions for interactions with protected objects.

### Introduction
In this lesson, we'll dive into Ethical AI, making sure AI is fair, transparent, and used for good, just like using a powerful tool responsibly. We'll also explore cutting-edge AI like ChatGPT and get hands-on to see AI in action.

### Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
* understand the fundamental concepts of AI.
* learn how to use AI technologies ethically.

### Materials Required
* Chrome Book

### What is Artificial?
- Made by people, often as a copy of something natural:
    - clothes made of artificial fibers
    - an artificial heart
    - an artificial lake
    - artificial fur/sweeteners/flowers (my example of snow cone flavors)

### What is Intelligence?

- The ability to solve complex problems or make decisions with outcomes benefiting the actor, and has evolved in lifeforms to adapt to diverse environments for their survival and reproduction.

### What is ArtificiaL Intelligence?
- Artificial intelligence, or “AI,” is the ability for a computer to **think** and **learn**.
- With AI, computers can perform tasks that are typically done by **people**, including processing language, problem-solving, and learning.
- AI is not human and doesn't necessarily think in the same way humans do. It can be very good for doing certain tasks it is trained to.
- AI is advancing really fast and is very likely to change the world significantly over the next few years.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Ethics
- Ethics refers to the concepts of right and wrong behavior. It relates to how individuals choose to interact with one another.
- You need to also think about when is it ok to use AI and when is it not.
  -  Is it ok to shortcut tasks that you need to do? 
  -  Is it ok to have an AI do your homework? 
  -  Send a card to someone on your behalf on their birthday? 
  -  Answer your emails, phone calls or texts?

### Current Modern Artificial Intelligence
- AI is not just robots like you see in the movies. 
- AI is usually just software running on machines called servers.
- A server is just a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called “clients.”

### Activities

#### Activity 1
- Work with your assigned partner
- Step 1: visit [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/) 
- Step 2: create a prompt to make a fake news story - this is the one we used together “write a fake news story about how dangerous downtown omaha is during the college world series. It should be a news bulletin for those traveling to Omaha”.


#### Activity 2
- Work with your table partner
- Step 1: visit https://chat.openai.com/ 
- Step 2: type “write a game with python. Then give it some rules for your game”
- Step 3: Think about some different scenarios where having AI code for you is ok to use and some where it might not be.
- The one we used together was: “write a cool game for microbits that I can paste into microsoft makecode”

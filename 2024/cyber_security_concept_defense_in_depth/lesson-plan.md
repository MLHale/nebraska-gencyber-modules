title: Cybersecurity Concept - Defense in Depth
---
### Summary
This lesson explores the concept of defense in depth by building a multi-layered security system using Microbits. Students will learn about cybersecurity concept and its practical application.

### Grade
Middle School

### Time Required
1 hour 45 minutes

### Cybersecurity Concepts
- [x] Defense in Depth
- [ ] Confidentiality 
- [ ] Integrity
- [ ] Availability
- [ ] Think Like an Adversary
- [ ] Keep it Simple

### Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to understand and explain the principles of defense in depth and its importance in cybersecurity.
* Students will be able to apply the concepts of defense in depth by designing and implementing a multi-layered security system using microbits

  
### Materials list
Microbit

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will be introduced to the concept of defense in depth by comparing a castle's security measures to a computer system's defenses. The analogy will highlight how multiple layers of protection can significantly enhance security.

#### Focused Activity
Students will draw a castle with various layers of physical defense (moat, walls, keep). They will discuss strengths and vulnerabilities of their designs.
Students will use LEDs to simulate a light-up drawbridge controlled by the Microbit.
Students will play a two-player game where one defends a Microbit system with togglable firewalls (represented by tilt gestures) against simulated attacks.
Students will explore a more advanced Microbit program with a password-protected drawbridge.


#### Closure

Summarize the benefits and importance of defense in depth in cybersecurity.
#### Reflection

Students will reflect how they can implement the concepts of defense in depth to protect their own online information and devices.

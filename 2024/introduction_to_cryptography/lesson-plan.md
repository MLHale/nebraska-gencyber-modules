### Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to understand the fundamental principles and concepts of cryptography, including encryption and decryption.   
* Students will be to able to apply basic cryptographic techniques to encode and decode messages which will enhance your problem-solving and analytical skills through hands-on activities.


### Materials list
* Caesar Cipher Wheel
* Brad
* Scissors
* Breakout box


### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity

Students will discuss real-life scenarios where securing messages might be important (e.g., sending passwords, confidential documents).

#### Focused Activity

Students will:
1. practice encryption and decryption by decoding messages using a Caesar Cipher wheel and create their own encrypted messages.
2. collaborate to build "Enigma"-inspired machines with rotating rotors and decode the messages.
3. face a "Cryptography Breakout Box" challenge by applying their newly learned skills.

#### Closure

Review what was discussed in the module.

#### Reflection

Students will reflect on the importance of cryptography in cybersecurity and explore its various applications in the real world.

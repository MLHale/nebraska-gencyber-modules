### What is Phishing?
- Phishing pretends to be someone you trust.
  - Deceptive emails, texts, or even fake websites will appear to come from a legitimate source like your bank, social media platform, or a friend.
- Phishing lures you in with a trick.
  - These messages will often create a sense of urgency or offer something tempting to get you to click on a link or download an attachment.
- Phishing steals your information.
  - The goal is to trick you into revealing sensitive details like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.

### Activity

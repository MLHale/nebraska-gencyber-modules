### Integrity
- How do we know that data has not been changed?
- Data could be changed on accident.
- Data could be changed on purpose.
- Integrity is the assurance that the data we have is the same as the data that was sent.


### Integrity of Images
- Imagine we have a 4x4 Black & White Image
  ![]()
- How can we verify this image is displayed as intended?
- We can add a bit in a 5th row/column.
- The 5th row/column should make the number of black bits even.
  ![]()
-Images are not sent as pictures.
- Images are sent as a series of zeros and ones
- Everything is sent as zeros and ones.

  
### Integrity of ISBN
- Before 2007, ISBNs were 10-digit long.
- After that year ISBNs extended to 13 digits. 
- In both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 standards, the last digit is the check digit, for error detection.
- ISBN-10 check digit is calculated by Modulus 11 with decreasing weights on the first 9 digits.

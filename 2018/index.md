Introduction to Cybersecurity First Principles	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_first_principles/	This lesson introduces the cybersecurity first principles, provides contextual examples of each, and includes activities based on the GenCyber card game.
Introduction to Git and Github	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_git_and_github/	This module introduces git and Github as technologies for managing, using, and tracking changes to resources, such as source code.
Intro to Components using Littlebits Droids	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_components_using_littlebits_droids/	This is a module about modules. It introduces component-based thinking using modular components in the Littlebits Droid Kit (TM).
Computational thinking and design process using Littlebits Droids	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/computational_thinking_and_design_process_using_littlebits_droids/	This module follows up on the intro to components by focusing on applying design process with littlebits to solve a real world problem.
Web services and IoT using Littlebits and IFTTT	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/web_services_and_iot_using_littlebits_and_ifttt/	This module explores how web service resources can be "mashed up" with IoT devices. Littlebits and a service called IFTTT are used as enabling technologies within the lesson.
Collaboration on Github	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/collaboration_on_github/	This modules follows up on the introduction to git and Github lesson and shows off how it can be used for managing collaborative projects - especially those related to software development
Understanding REST and APIs	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/understanding_rest_and_apis/	You use APIs every day, probably without know it. APIs, or application programming interfaces, allow different web servers to exchange information with one another. This lesson explores how this works using littlebits as an enabling technology.
Avoid Phishing URL analysis	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/phishing/	Some research has estimated that 60 billion phishing emails are sent out every year. This lesson explores techniques for spotting phish.
Online Safety and Privacy	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/online_safety_and_privacy/	Maintaining privacy and staying safe online means being cognizant of the kinds of information we put online and protecting our digital assets. The lesson explores these topics in a human-centric way. It also examines OSINT (or open source intelligence) to show how easy it is to find information online.

Avoid Phishing Email Header Analysis	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/phishing/	This follows up on the avoiding phishing lesson and explores how email headers are constructed.
Penetration Testing	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/penetration_testing/	Web servers are constantly bombarded with attacks. This lesson explores how developers can get ahead of attackers and test their web apps to identify vulnerabilities.
Ethics and Digital Citizenship	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/ethics_and_digital_citizenship/	Ethics are acting appropriately online are the two most important character traits of cybersecurity professionals. This lesson explores ethical behavior and licensing issues for appropriately using resources.
Introduction to Firewalls	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_firewalls/	Firewalls are a technology that block or allow network traffic according to a group of rules. This lesson introduces and explores firewalls interactively.

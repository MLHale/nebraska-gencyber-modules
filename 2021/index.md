Introduction to Cybersecurity First Principles	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/intro_to_first_principles/	This lesson introduces the cybersecurity first principles, provides contextual examples of each, and includes activities you can use with your students.
Teaching tools	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/teaching_tools/	A multi-part module focusing on a variety of ready-to-use classroom tricks for making activities and increasing engagement.
Intro to Components (using Rasberry Pi)	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/intro_to_components/	This is a module about modules. It introduces component-based thinking using modular components built for the Raspberry PI ecosystem.
Introduction to Computational Thinking and Design Process	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/introduction_to_computational_thinking_and_design_process/	This module introduces computational thinking and design process emphasizing key algorithmic steps necessary to conceptualize, breakdown, and solve problems.
Web services and IFTTT	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/web_services_and_ifttt/	This module explores how web service resources can be "mashed up" to create applications. A service called IFTTT is used as an enabling technology within the lesson.
Building an IoT Device (With Raspberry Pi and IFTTT)	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/building_an_iot_device/	 Extending prior lessons, this module connects a local hardware device to online web services and the broader internet of things.
Curriculum Standards	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/curriculum_standards/	This module helps relate the concepts at camp to educational standards
Online Safety and Privacy	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/online_safety_and_privacy/	Maintaining privacy and staying safe online means being cognizant of the kinds of information we put online and protecting our digital assets. The lesson explores these topics in a human-centric way. It also examines OSINT (or open source intelligence) to show how easy it is to find information online.
Internet of Strings	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/internet_of_strings/lesson-plan.md	This lesson will aid students in understanding how routing occurs within networks. The objective of the game is to deliver all packets from the originating computer to the receiving computer as quickly as possible.
Avoid Phishing URL analysis	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/phishing/	Some research has estimated that 60 billion phishing emails are sent out every year. This lesson explores techniques for spotting phish.
Ethics and Digital Citizenship	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/ethics_and_digital_citizenship/	Ethics are acting appropriately online are the two most important character traits of cybersecurity professionals. This lesson explores ethical behavior and licensing issues for appropriately using resources.
IoT Hardening	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/iot_hardening/	IoT devices often seem helpless against the villains of the Internet. There a few simple things (five in this lesson) that can go a long way to make your IoT devices a bit more harder to discover and attack.
Using REST and APIs	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/using_rest_and_apis/	You use APIs every day, probably without know it. APIs, or application programming interfaces, allow different web servers to exchange information with one another. This lesson explores APIs in the context of Raspberry PI and IFTTT.
Avoid Phishing Email Header Analysis	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/phishing/	This follows up on the avoiding phishing lesson and explores how email headers are constructed.
Ciphers and Cybersecurity in other fields	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/2021/ciphers_and_cybersecurity_in_other_fields/	This module looks at how cybersecurity can be used in classes like history or english - through concepts like ciphers.

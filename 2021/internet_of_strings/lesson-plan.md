# Lesson Plan: Hands-on IoT Internet of Strings

### Summary

This module will introduce students to networking and routing concepts through an interactive game.

### Learning Objectives

1. Students understand the role of routers, TCPs, & packets within networks.
2. Students will be able to visualize the activity of networks.

### Materials

* Index cards
* Paper to make labels
* Blue painters' tape
* Envelopes
* Post-it notes (for MS/HS version)

### Preparation (for a class of 30)

* Label 4 envelopes with “From: Computer 1, To: Computer 2”. Label the next 4 with “From: Computer 2, To: Computer 3”. Label the last 4 with “From: Computer 3, To: Computer 1”.
* Write 4-word phrases on the index cards - one word per index card.
* Create labels for computers, routers, and TCP for the floor network map. Give each computer & router a number (e.g. "Computer 1", "Router 1").
* Create a map on the ground using the blue tape and labels, using the map below as reference or creating your own.\*

\* If running the MS/HS version, the routing tables are only compatible with the given floor network map, so you will have to create your own routing tables if you modify the map.

### Learning Facilitation


### Warm-up Activity

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYdF7b3nMto) and host a discussion on routing tables and how packets travel over a network.

## Focused Activity

Students will role play as components of digital networks. The objective of the game is to successfully deliver a team's packets from an originating computer to its destination computer.

If time permits:
* Increase the difficulty by "breaking network lines" (cut the tape). Students will have to reroute to find the quickest route on the available network lines.
* Allow students to switch roles so they can better understanding other components of the network.

### Closure

Provide a 5 minute warning when the activity will end. Once complete, have all the students help put away the supplies.

### Reflection

Once the activity is over, host a discussion on how this activity translates to networking routing.

### Optional Alterations

-	If class is slightly larger/smaller than 30, simply get rid of as many router spots as needed. 
-	If class is significantly larger/smaller than 30, add or remove a computer; or change the length of the phrases at each computer.
-	To play outside, set up the game using chalk or use string/yarn as the network lines.

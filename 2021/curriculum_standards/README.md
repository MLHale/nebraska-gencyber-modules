<!-- ### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. It could be something such as a door, a speedometer, or a data structure in computer science. Abstraction decouples the design from the implementation. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth.

* __Data Hiding__: Data hiding is the technique that does not allow certain aspects of an object to be observed or accessed. Data and information hiding keeps the programmer from having complete access to data structures. It allows access to only what is necessary.

* __Minimization__: Minimization refers to having the least functionality necessary in a program or device. The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include **turning off ports that are not needed**, reducing the amount of code running on a machine, and/or turning off unneeded features in an application.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Resource Encapsulation__: Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. An example, assume a flag pole is the object. There are fixed methods on how the flag pole is to be used. Put the flag on, take the flag off, raise or lower the flag. Nothing else can be done to the flag pole.

### Introduction and goals
In this lesson, we will learn how to plug and play different web services together to make some simple inventions that can automate tasks and send alerts, alarms, and messages based on various triggers. -->

### Goals
By the end of this you will be:
- think about standards

<!-- ### Materials Required

* A free IFTTT Account (instructions to create one in this lesson) -->

### Slides
Here are the [slides](./img/slides.pptx). (The information from this slideshow is also printed below)

### Plans for the week
We are asking you to creeate a new cybersecurity lesson:
* For your classroom
* To share with others (this and future years)

You can do this alone or in small groups (2-3).
You will be able to have a "dry run" of the lesson by teaching it to this group. 
### Lesson Documentation
You will write up your new lesson in a prescribed format:
* title
* summary
* targeted grade/age level
* time requirement
* first principles addressed
* learning objectives
* standards addressed
* material list
### Continued...
* lesson plan (warm up, focused, closure, reflection)
* assessment
* accommodations
* extensions
* authorship
Creative Commons Licensee

### Dry Runs
We have allocated time for you to "practice" your lesson once and update any lesson documentation based on experience and feedback from the group. 

### Timing
Research and Prep
* Friday morning
* Monday morning
* Monday afternoon

Feedback
* Tuesday morning (circle share)
* Friday - dry runs

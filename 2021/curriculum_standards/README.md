<!-- ### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. It could be something such as a door, a speedometer, or a data structure in computer science. Abstraction decouples the design from the implementation. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth.

* __Data Hiding__: Data hiding is the technique that does not allow certain aspects of an object to be observed or accessed. Data and information hiding keeps the programmer from having complete access to data structures. It allows access to only what is necessary.

* __Minimization__: Minimization refers to having the least functionality necessary in a program or device. The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include **turning off ports that are not needed**, reducing the amount of code running on a machine, and/or turning off unneeded features in an application.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Resource Encapsulation__: Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. An example, assume a flag pole is the object. There are fixed methods on how the flag pole is to be used. Put the flag on, take the flag off, raise or lower the flag. Nothing else can be done to the flag pole.

### Introduction and goals
In this lesson, we will learn how to plug and play different web services together to make some simple inventions that can automate tasks and send alerts, alarms, and messages based on various triggers. -->

### Goals
By the end of this you will be:
- think about standards

<!-- ### Materials Required

* A free IFTTT Account (instructions to create one in this lesson) -->

title: Creating Educational Standards
---
### Goals

By the end of this week, you will understand how to create a lesson based on the below mentioned standards.

### Slides
Here are the [slides](./img/slides.pptx). (The information from this slideshow is also printed below)

### Plans for the week
We are asking you to create a new cybersecurity lesson both for your classroom and to share with others (in this and future years).

You can do this alone or in small groups (2-3).
You will be able to have a "dry run" of the lesson by teaching it to this group.
### Lesson Documentation
You will write up your new lesson in a prescribed format:
* title
* summary
* targeted grade/age level
* time requirement
* first principles addressed
* learning objectives
* standards addressed
* material list
### Continued...
* lesson plan (warm up, focused, closure, reflection)
* assessment
* accommodations
* extensions
* authorship
* Creative Commons Licensee

### Dry Runs
We have allocated time for you to "practice" your lesson once and update any lesson documentation based on experience and feedback from the group.

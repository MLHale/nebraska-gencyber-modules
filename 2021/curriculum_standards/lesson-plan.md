**Learning Facilitation**

In general we expect every lesson to have a warm-up activity (gently introduce the topic, connect to prior learning, explicitly state the purpose of learning the material and why the information is important), a focused activity where the majority of the learning occurs, and closure (wrap-up, summary of what was learned, how it applies to other topics, etc.).  Providing a reflection activity is beneficial to allow learners to further absorb the information and reflect on what they have experienced and learned.

**Warm up Activity**

Be as detailed as possible in defining one or more ways to introduce the topic. Connect to any previous topics the learners may understand and explain relevance of topic. Providing more than a single way to introduce the material is appreciated.

**Focused Activity**

Detailed lesson plan. Providing timings if known. If there are common student misconceptions or places where the lesson may be difficult for learners, please identify. If there are known “easy ways” to accomplish a task, please state, including any lessons learned. If there are places where learners may attempt to shortcut the lesson, please identify.  Basically include any and all information that you would want to know if you were going to teach the lesson.

**Closure**

Provide a means to wrap-up the lesson and what content should be reviewed. What are the important concepts / objectives that learners should remember?

**Reflection**

Is there an activity (journal prompt, partner discussion topic, etc.) that would allow learners to reflect on the material?  If so, please identify.

**Assessment**

Indicate an appropriate assessment activity to determine if the learning objectives have been met. You may link to another file (test, quiz, etc.) or other website (Kahoot, Quizlet) if assessments have been created.

**Accommodations for students with disabilities**

If the lesson needs to be modified for students with disabilities, please include that information here.

**Extension Activity (ies)**

Please give information on additional activities that serve as follow-up, can be done by students who finish early, or as at home assignments.

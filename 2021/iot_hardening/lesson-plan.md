# Lesson Plan IoT Hardening

### Summary
The module will review steps necessary to harden an IoT device using the example of a Raspberry Pi. In this lesson, we will review the importance of software updates, user management, network management, and intrusion detection systems.

### Learning Objectives

1. What is __Hardening__ and why is it important.
2. How make it harder for attackers to profile your IoT.
3. How to configure a firewall with firewall rules.
4. Add multiple layers of defense to a device.

### Materials list

* Access to Internet

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Ask what do you already know about it __Hardening__ an Internet connected device?

#### Vocabulary
* Firewall
* Intrusion Detection
* User management

#### Unplugged Activity Example
1. Assign two students to be personal computers in a network. Give them signs to put on their chest that say personal computer.

2. Assign two students to be the Firewall. Have students extend their arms out and connect them. Have them stand in front of the personal computer students.

3. Have one student stand behind the Firewall students and give them a sign that says Internet.

4. Facilitate discussion on why a Firewall is important.

5. Facilitate discussion on how a packet of information will travel internal and external.

6. Show video:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UtiQwCX2wU)

7. Review Firewalls as a Collection of Valves and discuss Firewall Rules.

8. Author ufw (uncomplicated fire wall) firewall rules for a Linux OS (Raspberry Pi)

9. Consider similar activities for other IoT Hardening Concepts.

#### Closure

Review what was discussed in the module.

#### Reflection

Review how cybersecurity first principles were demonstrated in this module.

### Assessment

Students will demonstrate an understanding of definitions, terminology, and command prompts through a game of Jeopardy/Kahoot Game.

e.g. Quiz / Presentation / Project / Writing Assignment / Observation / Walk Around / Oral Questioning / Other

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

N/A

### Extension Activities / Additional Readings

Point students to additional resources in the module.

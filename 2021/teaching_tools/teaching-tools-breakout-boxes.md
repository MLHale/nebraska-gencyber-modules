# Unit 6-2: Teaching tools (Breakout Boxes)

**What is a Breakout Box?**

In a Breakout Box activity, students work together and think critically to "break into" a box that has several locks attached to it. Students must solve challenging puzzles and follow directions carefully to succeed at unlocking all the locks on the box. Breakout Box activities allow students to demonstrate and practice the "the four C's" (Critical Thinking, Creativity, Collaboration, and Communication) Social Emotional Learning.

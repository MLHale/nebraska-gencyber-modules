* Lay all the metal nuts down flat on the table. 
* Before starting the one minute timer, explain that students will use the stick to pick up one metal nut and stack it upright on the table. The nuts must stand up on their sides so that you can see through the hole. If working in groups, pass the stick to the next person in their group to repeat the instructions but staking the second metal nut on top of the first metal nut.
* <ins>Alternate way to play this game:</ins> Put all the metal nuts on the stick and have students slide each metal nut off the stick individually, placing it on the table upright.
* The winner is the individual or team that has the most metal nuts stacked at the end of the minute timer.

**How to Play:**
* Put students into groups of 4.
* Give each group a stack of 6 cups and a rubberband/zip tie tool.
* Place the stack of cups on the table. Remind students that the cups need to start in a stack. 
Before starting the one minute timer, explain that each student in a group of four will grab one of the zip ties attached to the rubberband. Students will work together as a team to expand the rubberband, put it over top of the stack of cups, grab the first cup in the stack, pull up, and then place the cup on the table. Students will repeat this process until they have created a 6 cup pyramid. 
* The winner is the team that has the most cups stacked at the end of the minute timer.
* <ins>Alternate way to play this game:</ins> Instead of using a timer, have groups race to see which group can create the 6 cup pyramid first.

### **3. Marshmallow Transfer Game**

**Goal:** Use a straw to transfer as many marshmallows from one plate to the other.

**What You’ll Need:**
* Bag of mini marshmallows
* [Straws](https://www.amazon.com/Colorful-Plastic-Flexible-Straws-diameter/dp/B07XXNC3GH/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=straws&qid=1623815152&sr=8-4) (one straw per student)

**How to Play:**
* Give each student a straw.
* Put students into groups of 4-5.
* Set up two tables 4-5 feet apart.
* On one table, give each group a plate of mini marshmallows. On the other table put an empty plate. 
* Before starting the one minute timer, explain that each student, one at a time, will use their straw to suck up one marshmallow and transfer it to the empty plate. If the marshmallow drops on the floor, students need to go back to the plate of marshmallows and suck up a new marshmallow. After one student transfers their marshmallow to the empty plate, the next student in the group will go.
* The winner is the group that has the most marshmallows transferred to the empty plate.

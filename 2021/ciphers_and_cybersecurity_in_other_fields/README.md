### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Data Hiding__: Data hiding is the technique that does not allow certain aspects of an object to be observed or accessed. Data and information hiding keeps the programmer from having complete access to data structures. It allows access to only what is necessary.

* __Layering__: Cyber security uses multiple layers of defense or protecting information. If one layer is defeated the next layer should catch it.

* __Least Privilege__: One of the ways to protect information is by limiting what people can see and do with your information and resources. The principle of least privilege says to allow the minimum number of privileges necessary to accomplish the task.


* __Pre-digital era Ciphers__: Transposition ciphers – rearrange the order of the characters of plaintext also called permutation ciphers
The arrangement becomes the key
Substitution ciphers – replace the characters with something else (e.g. another character or number)
The replacement function becomes the key


### Introduction
In this lesson, we will learn about ciphers and basic cryptography and how it can apply to cybersecurity and other areas of education.  We will go over a brief history of the usage of ciphers and how they work.  

### Goals
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
* Understand and be able to describe `data hiding`, `layering`, and `least privilege` in terms of cryptography
* Encrypt and decrypt simple messages using different Ciphers

### Materials Required

* Cipher Wheels
* Vigenere Square

### Prerequisite lessons
None

### Step 1: Learn all the words!
__Plaintext/Cleartext__ - an unaltered message as it's intended to be read

__Ciphertext__ – message that has been changed so its meaning is concealed

__Encryption/enciphering__ – changing plaintext to ciphertext

__Decryption/deciphering__ – changing ciphertext back into plaintext

__Key__ – secret value needed to encrypt and/or decrypt

__Cryptographic Algorithm/cipher__ – a standard sequence of computational steps to encrypt or decrypt a message using a key

__Cryptanalysis__ – practice of analyzing encrypted messages to reveal the plaintext without knowing the key

__Strength__ – determines how much effort and how long it takes to break a ciphertext

### Step 2: Ciphers

- Zig-Zag and Route Crypto
- Civil War Crypto Sticks
- Caesar Ciphers
> ![Caesar](./img/caesarciper.jpg)
- Vigenere Square
> ![vigenere](./img/vigenere.png)
- Enigma Machine  

We will discuss the usages and history of each of these ciphers.


### Step 3: Cryptanalysis

- Frequency  
By doing frequency analysis to see which letters appeared most often then substituting most frequent plain text letter, could break the cipher.
- Language characteristics  
If spaces are left in, then characteristics like single letter and 2 letter words are still in tact and knowledge of these can be utilized to help in breaking
Having a longer message only makes both things easier to spot

### Step 4: Practice decrypting and encrypting

Using the cipher rings we will practice encoding and decoding.

### Self Exploration
Try some different encryption yourself.

### Reflection
In this lesson, we saw how encryption can be used for `data hiding`. Multiple encryption rounds can also be used as for `layering`.

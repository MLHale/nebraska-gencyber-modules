### Learning Objectives

* Students will learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages by using ciphers. 

### Materials list

* Cipher Wheels
* Vigenere Square
* Scratch paper and pencils

#### Focused Activity
* Explain the history behind ciphers (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/caesar-cipher)
* Have students use a cipher wheel to decrypt given phrases. 
  
    **How to decrypt:**
    * Line up the letter 'A' on the inner wheel with the number of the key on the outer wheel. 
    * Find the first letter of the encrypted phrase on the outer wheel. Write down the letter on the inner wheel that lines up with it (this is the decrypted letter)
    * Repeat step 2 with each letter until you see the decrypted phrase. 


* Have students use a cipher wheel to encrypt phrases that they come up with.
    
    **How to encrypt:**
    * Come up with a phrase you would like to write in code. 
    * Choose a number to use as your key, then line up this number on the outer wheel with the 'A' on the inner wheel. 
    * Find the letter of your phrase on the inner wheel, then write down the letter on the outer wheel that lines up with it. 
    * Repeat step 3 for every letter in your phrase.
    

* Students can pair up to encrypt/decrypt phrases that their partner comes up with.
#### Reflection
* Ask your students questions and have them reflect on which/how cybersecurity principles relate to the activity.

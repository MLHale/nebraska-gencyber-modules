title: Intro to Components using Littlebits Droids
---


### Summary
This is a module about modules. It introduces component-based thinking using modular components in the `Littlebits Droid Kit (TM)`.

### Grade
6-10

### Time Required
1-2 hours

### First principles
- [ ] Domain Separation
- [ ] Process Isolation
- [x] Resource Encapsulation
- [x] Modularity
- [ ] Least Privilege
- [x] Abstraction
- [ ] Data Hiding
- [ ] Layering
- [x] Simplicity
- [ ] Minimization

### Learning Objectives

1. Student will be able to use input and output modules to assemble a larger device.
2. Student will understand the benefits of modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation.

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by unboxing Littlebits and examining the components.

#### Focused Activity
Students will make circuits and add components to them to solve small problems - including driving a droid around.

#### Closure
Students will finish a few missions to see how components can be combined to solve more complex challenges.

#### Reflection
Students will review relevant first principles learned through the lesson.

### Assessment

1. Walk Around
1. Oral Questioning
1. Quiz

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

N/A

### Extension Activity (ies)

Self exploration to try some different component configurations.

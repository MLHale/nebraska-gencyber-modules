### Learning Objectives

1. Students will be able to build a Raspberry PI
1. Students will be able to use GPIOs to make a simple sensor platform
1. Students will be able to define and relate the `modularity` principle to component-based design frameworks like Raspberry PI
1. Students will be able to follow component setup and operation instructions.

### Materials list

* (Raspberry PI 4 (Labists kit or equivalent))[https://www.amazon.com/LABISTS-Raspberry-Complete-Preloaded-Heatsinks/dp/B07YRSYR3M/]
* (Raspberry PI 4 touchscreen)[https://www.amazon.com/Miuzei-Raspberry-Full-Angle-Heatsinks-Raspbian/dp/B07XBVF1C9/]

* USB Keyboard and Mouse
* Power outlet nearby

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by unboxing a Raspberry PI and assorted components.

#### Focused Activity
Students will setup a Raspberry PI and prepare it for connection to components.

#### Closure
Students will make a circuit using a light component.

#### Reflection
Students will review relevant first principles learned through the lesson.

### Assessment

1. Walk Around
1. Oral Questioning
1. Test functionality of device
1. Quiz (Kahootz)

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

N/A

### Extension Activity (ies)

Self exploration to try some different designs.

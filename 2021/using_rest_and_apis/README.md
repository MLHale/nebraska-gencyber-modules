### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. It could be something such as a door, a speedometer, or a data structure in computer science. Abstraction decouples the design from the implementation. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth.

* __Data Hiding__: Data hiding is the technique that does not allow certain aspects of an object to be observed or accessed. Data and information hiding keeps the programmer from having complete access to data structures. It allows access to only what is necessary.

* __Layering__: Cyber security uses multiple layers of defense or protecting information. If one layer is defeated the next layer should catch it.

* __Least Privilege__: One of the ways to protect information is by limiting what people can see and do with your information and resources. The principle of least privilege says to allow the minimum number of privileges necessary to accomplish the task.

* __Minimization__: Minimization refers to having the least functionality necessary in a program or device. The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include **turning off ports that are not needed**, reducing the amount of code running on a machine, and/or turning off unneeded features in an application.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Resource Encapsulation__: Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. An example, assume a flag pole is the object. There are fixed methods on how the flag pole is to be used. Put the flag on, take the flag off, raise or lower the flag. Nothing else can be done to the flag pole.

* __Simplicity__: Simplicity allows a person to better understand hardware and software. Without the clutter of unnecessarily complicated code and interfaces, the software will be more understandable by people that will update the code when requirements change. It will be easier to understand by the testers and they will be able to spot problems sooner. By keeping software as simple and as focused as possible, the reliability and security is greatly increased.

### Step 1: Background
Before we get started, lets talk about what an `API` is.

Credit: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#)
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)

**HTTP** is a `protocol` which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

![A Web document is the composition of different resources](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13677/Fetching_a_page.png)

Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called `requests` and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called `responses`.

![HTTP as an application layer protocol, on top of TCP (transport layer) and IP (network layer) and below the presentation layer.](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13673/HTTP%20&%20layers.png)Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over `TCP`, or over a `TLS`-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.

#### HTTP Messages

HTTP messages are composed of textual information encoded in ASCII, and span over multiple lines. In HTTP/1.1, and earlier versions of the protocol, these messages were openly sent across the connection. In HTTP/2, the once human-readable message is now divided up into HTTP frames, providing optimization and performance improvements.

Web developers, or webmasters, rarely craft these textual HTTP messages themselves: software, a Web browser, proxy, or Web server, perform this action. They provide HTTP messages through config files (for proxies or servers), APIs (for browsers), or other interfaces.

![From a user-, script-, or server- generated event, an HTTP/1.x msg is generated, and if HTTP/2 is in use, it is binary framed into an HTTP/2 stream, then sent.](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13825/HTTPMsg2.png)


The HTTP/2 binary framing mechanism has been designed to not require any alteration of the APIs or config files applied: it is broadly transparent to the user.

HTTP requests, and responses, share similar structure and are composed of:

1.  A `start-line` describing the requests to be implemented, or its status of whether successful or a failure. This start-line is always a single line.
2.  An optional set of `HTTP headers` specifying the request, or describing the body included in the message.
3.  A blank line indicating all meta-information for the request have been sent.
4.  An optional `body` containing data associated with the request (like content of an HTML form), or the document associated with a response. The presence of the body and its size is specified by the start-line and HTTP headers.

The start-line and HTTP headers of the HTTP message are collectively known as the `head` of the requests, whereas its payload is known as the `body`.

![Requests and responses share a common structure in HTTP](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13827/HTTPMsgStructure2.png)

#### HTTP Requests

##### Start line

`HTTP requests` are messages sent by the client to initiate an action on the server. Their `start-line` contain three elements:

1.  An **HTTP Method**, a verb (like `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`) or a noun (like `HEAD` or `OPTIONS`), that describes the action to be performed. For example, `GET` indicates that a resource should be fetched or `POST` means that data is pushed to the server (creating or modifying a resource, or generating a temporary document to send back). `PUT` modifies an existing resource, while `DELETE` removes one.
2.  The **request target**, usually a `URL`, or the absolute path of the protocol, port, and domain are usually characterized by the request context. The format of this request target varies between different HTTP methods. It can be
    *   An absolute path, ultimately followed by a `'?'` and query string. This is the most common form, known as the _origin form_, and is used with `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` methods.  
        `POST / HTTP 1.1  
        GET /background.png HTTP/1.0  
        HEAD /test.html?query=alibaba HTTP/1.1  
        OPTIONS /anypage.html HTTP/1.0`
    *   A complete URL, known as the _absolute form_, is mostly used with `GET` when connected to a proxy.  
        `GET http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages HTTP/1.1`
    *   The authority component of a URL, consisting of the domain name and optionally the port (prefixed by a `':'`), is called the _authority form_. It is only used with `CONNECT` when setting up an HTTP tunnel.  
        `CONNECT developer.mozilla.org:80 HTTP/1.1`
    *   The _asterisk form_, a simple asterisk (`'*'`) is used with `OPTIONS`, representing the server as a whole.  
        `OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1`
3.  The **HTTP version** which defines the structure of the remaining message, acting as an indicator of the expected version to use for the response.

#### Headers

`HTTP headers` from a request follow the same basic structure of an HTTP header: a case-insensitive string followed by a colon (`':'`) and a value whose structure depends upon the header. The whole header, including the value, consist of one single line, which can be quite long.

There are numerous request headers available. They can be divided in several groups:

*   **General headers**, like `Via`,  apply to the message as a whole.
*   **Request headers**, like `User-Agent`, `Accept-Type`, modify the request by specifying it further (like `Accept-Language`), by giving context (like `Referer`), or by conditionally restricting it (like `If-None`).
*   **Entity headers**, like `Content-Length` which apply to the body of the request. Obviously there is no such header transmitted if there is no body in the request.

![Example of headers in an HTTP request](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13821/HTTP_Request_Headers2.png)

#### Body

The final part of the request is its body. Not all requests have one: requests fetching resources, like `GET`, `HEAD`, DELETE, or OPTIONS, usually don't need one. Some requests send data to the server in order to update it: as often the case with `POST` requests (containing HTML form data).

Bodies can be broadly divided into two categories:

*   **Single-resource bodies**, consisting of one single file, defined by the two headers: `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`.
*   **[Multiple-resource bodies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#multipartform-data)**, consisting of a `multipart body`, each containing a different bit of information. This is typically associated with `HTML Forms`.

#### HTTP Responses

##### Status line

The start line of an HTTP response, called the `status line`, contains the following information:

1.  The `protocol version`, usually `HTTP/1.1`.
2.  A `status code`, indicating success or failure of the request. Common status codes are `200` (ok), `404` (Not found), or `500` (Server error)
3.  A `status text`. A brief, purely informational, textual description of the status code to help a human understand the HTTP message.

A typical status line looks like: `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found.`

#### Headers

`HTTP headers` for responses follow the same structure as any other header: a case-insensitive string followed by a colon (`':'`) and a value whose structure depends upon the type of the header. The whole header, including its value, presents as a single line.

![Example of headers in an HTTP response](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13823/HTTP_Response_Headers2.png)

#### Body

The last part of a response is the `body`. Not all responses have one: responses with a status code, like `201` or `204`, usually don't.

Bodies can be broadly divided into three categories:

*   **Single-resource bodies**, consisting of a single file of known length, defined by the two headers: `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`.
*   **Single-resource bodies**, consisting of a single file of unknown length, encoded by chunks with `Transfer-Encoding` set to `chunked`.
*   **[Multiple-resource bodies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#multipartform-data)**, consisting of a multipart body, each containing a different section of information. These are relatively rare.

### Step 2: Ok, lets take a look at a real API
Phew, enough background. In the previous [lesson](../web_services_and_iot_using_littlebits_droids_and_ifttt/README.md), we wired our `cloudbit` up to the web and explored how we could send it signals using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com). We saw that if our `cloudbit` detected an input signal (a `request`), we could have `IFTTT` do something (send a `response`). These concepts, i.e. _request_ and _response_, are central to the concept of `RESTful APIs`. REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are tools that developers use to provide __abstraction__ and __resource encapsulation__ to people who want to interact with their data.

APIs allow you to get and save data back to the application, without needing to tightly integrate with that application. This improves __simplicity__ and helps your code to be more __modular__. APIs include `endpoints`, such as `/api/events`, that allow you to access certain specific data (e.g. events in this example). API endpoints help provide __minimization__ since users can only interact with the application through those interfaces provided by the developer.

...Enough talk! Lets look at an API!

Open Chrome and go to [http://developers.littlebitscloud.cc/](http://developers.littlebitscloud.cc/). You are looking at the `cloudbit` API. This is what `IFTTT` uses to handle requests and responses.

You can see that Littlebits tells us all about how to interact with our `cloudbit` using the API. Lets try it out.

### Step 3: Getting our API Key
Secure APIs don't just accept requests and provide responses to anyone. APIs use a concept called `least privilege` to allow end-users to only have access to the features they need. Since we own the `cloudbit`, we should have the ability to do anything we want with it, but we might want to prevent other people from abusing and misusing our cloudbit.

To ensure that only we can program our cloudbit, Littlebits provides something called an `API Key`. This key is a really long alphanumerical string that would be hard to crack. Lets find our key, so we can issue commands to our cloudbit.

> 2018 note, for the purposes of our lesson today, you will be using a key I have setup for your use, thus you don't need to get your own API Key.

Go to [http://control.littlebitscloud.cc/](http://control.littlebitscloud.cc/)

Login using the account you used in the [previous lesson](../web_services_and_iot_using_littlebits_droids_and_ifttt/)

Once logged in, click on your `cloudbit`:

Now go to the `settings` menu. You should see your access token `API Key`, you will need this string in next steps - so keep it handy. In practice, you wouldn't want to share this with anyone.

### Step 4: Making your first REST request
Now that we have our `API Key`, lets use it to make a request.

POSTMAN is a REST client, that allows end users to make requests to test their APIs. Lets use it to test the cloudbit API. Launch POSTMAN by typing ```chrome://apps``` into the Chrome address bar, hit enter, and then click the POSTMAN icon.

![Loading Postman](../img/postman1.png)

In POSTMAN, lets build a new GET request targeted at the URL [https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices](https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices)

* Find and click the ```headers``` button and add the following

```
Authorization: Bearer <your access token with no angled brackets>
```

> 2018 note, use the following key I have setup for you 

```
Authorization: Bearer 3111600dc0d5bd1f6cd25d39ed11302e182a23dff77d77cc8d79ab6def76fc60
```

You can add the header as a key value pair, where the key is ```Authorization``` and the value is ```Bearer <insert your access token here, remove the angled brackets>```. Make sure to use your access token.

* Hit the ```send``` button to issue the _GET request_ to the URL.

If all goes well you should see something like:

![GET request](../img/postman2.png)

* The `response` you got back, when you sent the GET request contains the name and meta information for each of the `cloudbits` currently connected to your account. In the screenshot above, the JSON data returned for me was:

```
[
    {
        "label": "mlhale-cloudbit",
        "id": "00e04c036f15",
        "subscriptions": [],
        "subscribers": [],
        "user_id": 175306,
        "is_connected": true,
        "input_interval_ms": 200
    }
]
```
This tells me the label of my `cloudbit` is ```mlhale-cloudbit``` and that it currently doesn't have any subscribers or subscriptions.

### Step 5: GET device info
Now that we know our device id, we can use it to make a specific `request` for our device.

* make a new `GET` request in POSTMAN to

```
https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices/<your-device-id>
```

> 2018 note, for today's lesson you will use the cloudbit I have setup for you 

```
https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices/243c201ece7c
```

* e.g. ```https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices/00e04c036f15``` in my example

You should get the same device info back, but notice that it is now not in square brackets - this means it is a singleton instead of a list.

![GET request](../img/postman3.png).

### Step 6: First POST request to turn the device on
Now that we have the basics of GET requests to access device info, lets try issuing a POST request to actually make our device do something.

* Make sure you arrange your Littlebits as shown in the following picture:

![Littlebits Setup](../img/configuration.jpg)

> 2018 note, for today's lesson the cloudbit configuration is on the south east corner wall 

* make a POST request using POSTMAN to set the voltage output on the cloudbit for a few seconds

```
https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices/<your-device-id>/output
```

> 2018 note, for today's lesson you will use the cloudbit I have setup for you 

```
https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices/243c201ece7c/output
```

* e.g. ```https://api-http.littlebitscloud.cc/v2/devices/00e04c036f15/output``` in my example

Before you issue the request make sure the headers are set as follows:

Headers:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your access token>
Content-type: application/json
```

> 2018 note, use the following header parameters

```
Authorization: Bearer 3111600dc0d5bd1f6cd25d39ed11302e182a23dff77d77cc8d79ab6def76fc60
Content-type: application/json
```

![POST request](../img/postman4.png)

Now click on the Body tab (next to the Headers tab). Select the Raw input option and type the JSON shown below to tell `cloudbit` to turn its output to 100% and to stay on for 5 seconds.

Body:
```
{
    "percent": 100,
    "duration_ms": 5000
}
```

![POST request](../img/postman5.png)

Now send the request
You should get back:

```
{
    "success": true
}
```

and you should see your the cloudbit light up. You just used REST! 

### Exercise 
Assume the cloudbit is now hooked up to the droid inventor kit from previous lessons. Assume the following code is written in scratch:

![Scratch Program](../img/scratch-program.jpg)

Also assume the droidkit is wired up as the output of our cloudbit. 

Trigger each of the conditions by making `POST` requests to the littlebits API. 

### Checkpoint

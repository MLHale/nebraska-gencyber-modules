### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by using paper and post it notes in a Role playing activity to get a physical conception of a REST API.

#### Focused Activity
Students will use POSTMAN rest client to connect to the little bits api and make GET and POST requests.

#### Closure
Students will make a mashup to signal the little bits api to light up an LED using a restful request.

#### Reflection
Students will review and reflect relevant first principles learned through though lesson. 

### Assessment

## Cybersecurity First Principles

### What are Cybersecurity first principles?

The principles are basic activities in designing a good security system.

### Stepping through the principles

We now examine 10 cybersecurity first principles.

#### 1. Domain Separation
> Define boundaries around protected objects.

#### 2. Process Isolation
> Create barriers around protected objects.

#### 3. Resource Encapsulation
> Monitor interactions with protected objects.

#### 4. Least Privilege
> Define permissions for interactions with protected objects.  

#### 5. Layering
> Use more than one way to stop an intrusion.

#### 6. Abstraction
> Adapt computers for their use.

#### 7. Data Hiding
> Hide protected objects from unwanted exposure.

#### 8. Modularity
> Use interchangeable components.

#### 9. Simplicity
> Avoid unnecessary complexity.

#### 10. Minimization
> Reduce exposed areas.

### How do the First Principles Relate to each other?
Think of the first four principles are the necessary elements of building a protection mechanism, like a Castle: Wall, Door, Guard and Check. They help you answer the question, how to build a protection mechanism.
The rest of the principles that follow, contribute to the quality of the protection mechanism. They help you answer the question, how good is the protection mechanism.

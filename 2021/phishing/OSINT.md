title: Phishing - OSINT Gathering
---

### Cybersecurity First Principles
* __Layering__: Cybersecurity uses multiple layers of defense when protecting information or resources. If one layer is defeated the next layer should still be defending.

* __Information Hiding__: Information hiding is any attempt to prevent people from being able to see information. It can be hiding the content of a letter, or it can be applied to hiding how the letter is delivered. Both ways can prevent people from being able to see the information. This lesson looks at how malicious information can be hidden in URLs or other data fields.

## Open Source INTelligence Gathering

### Spear-Phishing
Crafting URLs is just one part of the deception used by spammers. *Spear-Phishing* is a social engineering technique where a spammer uses intimate details about your life, your contacts, and/or recent activities to tailor a very specific phishing attack.

There is a ton of information on the web pertaining to most of us. This is true even if you do not use social media. Voting registries, court records, county and property records, phone books, online review sites are just some examples. If you use social media, then there is a lot more information to collect. All you need is your target's name to start `reconnaissance` (Hey! thats the name of a card in our Gencyber Card Deck. See if you can find it).

Visit these sites and see how much information is available about yourself or a family member. You may have to pick the correct entry from the search results. But that should be easy with additional information about age and location of your target.:

Sites like Facebook, Linkedin, company websites, organizational charts and employee directories, make it easy to craft emails from colleagues, friends, and family. There are commercial tools available to collect what is called Open Source INTelligence or OSINT. Here is a tool that does just that: https://www.paterva.com/web7/buy/maltego-clients/maltego.php

> Maltego is an interactive data mining tool that renders directed graphs for link analysis. The tool is used in online investigations for finding relationships between pieces of information from various sources located on the Internet.

> **Security Tip**: Even when clicking on links in emails or websites shared by close colleagues, friends, and family; trust but verify. This advice will seem even more reasonable after going through the Email analysis module.

Is your information included in a breach? This website [https://haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) helps you identify if you or your family's information has been exposed in a data breach. Try your own email or someone in your family.

### Geolocation

GPS-enabled smartphones allow photos, videos, messages and social media posts to be **Geotagged**. Location information is embedded in the metadata for media alongside file name, date, camera information, etc. When geotagged media is shared publicly, location information is often inadvertently shared along with it. Such information aggregated over time starts to reveal private information such as: work and home locations, daily routines, frequented places, vacation destinations, shopping places, and much more.

Tools are freely available for conducting Geolocation OSINT. For example, this tool is aptly named geoCreepy!

Here is an image of some of our colleages found through this website: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/sociotechnika/41740794011/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sociotechnika/41740794011/)

To spread awareness of such issues with social media, an educational web application has been developed.

http://app.teachingprivacy.org (Beware of the ".com" version of this site. This is called [`domain-squatting`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting))

This web-application takes a twitter handle and aggregates all publicly available geotagged information on a map. For example, here are the travel patterns of Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple.

It is often prudent for celebrities and politicians to turn off geotagging in their posts. For instance, if you have a twitter account, there is a setting (Settings --> Security and Privacy) to delete any previously tagged locations.

Protecting privacy requires **Information Hiding**. Deleting or hiding metadata prevents sensitive patterns from being learned over time. This is true even for encrypted `https` Internet traffic. While `https` encryption protects message contents, it still reveals the communication endpoints. Over time an accurate communication graph can be built by examining many such communications. To conceal browsing patterns over the Internet, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are very effective. VPNs work by forming a tunnel between your current connection and a known network (such as the unomaha network). Once a tunnel is formed, all requests you make appear as if they originate from within the known network, since they emanate from the location you have tunneled to.

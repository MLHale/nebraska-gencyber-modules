Phishing is an attempt to deceive an individual using fraudulent emails or websites. Unsuspecting users click on malicious URLs and attachments to become a victim of cybercrime. Internet users need to understand how to read URLs and Email Headers to avoid falling prey to Phishing schemes.

This module has two parts. The first part is about the _right_ way to reading a URL and spotting common tricks used in crafting malicious links.

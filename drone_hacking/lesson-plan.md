* Safety glasses
* Optional: extra batteries and charger

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by getting introduced to safety rules for flying drones.

#### Focused Activity
Students will use **Parrot Template environment** to write several commands for their drones.

#### Closure
Students will connect and maneuver their drones using the commands.

#### Reflection
Students will review relevant first principles learned through the lesson. A small kahoots (or similar) quiz will be given

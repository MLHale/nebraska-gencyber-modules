<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Email is an indispensable communication tool. We use it every day. Unfortunately, many attacks also originate in emails. Wouldn’t it be great if everyone had some mad email ninja skills! Don’t worry, at the end of this session, you should feel pretty good about your email analysis skills.</p>

<p>A vigilant, trained and aware human user is a critical layer of defense against threats, both internal and external. Even if malicious URLs and emails get past spam filters and anti-virus software, a human user can catch it. Such a defensive strategy is common in secure system designs. It also demonstrates a cyber security first principle called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Layering.</code></p>

<p>When reading emails, the first item that grabs our attention is the sender’s name, email, and subject. But, it may come as a surprise that spoofing these in an email is a pretty easy thing! It is also effective at fooling unsuspecting email users. Take a look at some of the statistics in the <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/">Verizon Data Breach Reports</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How long does an attacker have to wait to get that foot in the door? We aggregated the results of over 150,000 e-mails sent as part of sanctioned tests by two of our security awareness partners and measured how much time had passed from when the message was sent to when the recipient opened it, and if they were influenced to click or provide data (where the real damage is done). The data showed that nearly 50% of users open e-mails and click on phishing links within the first hour. [Verizon DBIR 2014]
<img src="../img/dbirstats.png" alt="verzon dbir stats" /></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It did not get any better in 2016: <em><strong>13%</strong> of people tested click on a phishing attachment; median time to click is very
 short.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Update from 2017: <em>“<strong>Phishing via email</strong> was the most prevalent variety of social attacks”</em> Social attacks were utilized in 43% of all breaches in the 2017 dataset. Almost all phishing attacks that led to a breach were followed with some form of malware, and 28% of phishing breaches were targeted. Phishing is the most common social tactic in the 2017 dataset (93% of social incidents).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are a bad guy planning a heist, Phishing emails are the easiest way for getting malware into an organization. Because of that, it is prudent to understand exactly where an email is really coming from. Do not rush to open attachments or click links in emails. Verizon DBIR states <em>over 99% of malware is sent by either email or web server</em>.</p>

<h2 id="email-headers">Email Headers</h2>

<p>Email Headers hold a lot of information. Much of this information is never displayed to the user. The email reader only sees a select few pieces of information like the subject, date, and the sender’s email and info. The surprising part is that the information that is actually displayed to a user can be easily forged!</p>

<p>Before we get started, consider this email from President Donald Trump to a Researcher at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. They have a great Cybersecurity program. They recently obtained the prestigious <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/educators/centers-academic-excellence/cyber-operations/">CAE-CO</a> (Cyber Operations) designation from NSA. You may read about the available degree programs in Cybersecurity here: https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/academics/cybersecurity.php</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="../img/emailfrompresident.png" alt="email" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways…we see emails like this all the time using desktop or web-based email clients. The section pointed to by the big red arrow in the figure above, is the part of the email header that most people are familiar with.</p>

<p>There is more to this header. To reveal the full message header, different desktop or web email applications have different methods. Here are instructions to get the full email headers using popular email applications:</p>

<h4 id="apple-mail">Apple Mail</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="../img/applemail.png" alt="applemail" /></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="outlook-desktop-client">Outlook Desktop Client</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="../img/outlook.png" alt="outlook" /></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="outlook-web-client">Outlook Web Client</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="../img/outlookweb.png" alt="outlookweb" /></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="gmail">Gmail</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="../img/gmail.png" alt="gmail" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is obvious that in all cases, full email headers are hard to find if you don’t know where to look.</p>

<p>Once you do find it, there is a ton of information in the header about the route taken by an email. Let’s look at some actual email headers. Open up the files in the <a href="../email-headers">“email-headers” Folder</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the raw message from <a href="../email-headers/email-header1.txt">email-header1.txt</a></p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion:</h3>
<p>What are your first thoughts?</p>

<h2 id="headers-are-like-passports">Headers are like Passports</h2>

<p>Consider a Turkey citizen, who is traveling from the U.S. to China via stops in Germany and India. Authorities in countries in each leg of her trip would record the source and destination of the previous leg in the passport.  Assume that she has appropriate visas for all the visited countries. One way to describe the journey in her passport could be as follows, with the most recent entry at the top:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Passenger-Received: from India by China     # Chinese Authority
Passenger-Received: from Germany by India   # Indian Authority
Passenger-Received: from U.S. by Germany    # German Authority
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The header is like a passport for your email. The header receives an entry at every stop along the way by the email server it encounters. As a result, the more servers the email is routed through, the longer the header.</p>

<p>Now, if you observe <a href="../email-headers/email-header1.txt">email-header1.txt</a> there seems to be a lot of <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">Received:</code></strong> entries in there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, where in this file should we start to trace the email source/origin and the stops that it took to get to the final destination?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is some information to help us do this. As an email travels from the source to its destination, each server adds its header entries to the top of the email body. So if we want to trace the email origin, this will be the very first <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">Received:</code></strong> entry encountered from the <strong>bottom of the raw email</strong>. If you see something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Received-SPF:</code>, ignore it.</p>

<p>For <a href="../email-headers/email-header1.txt">email-header1.txt</a> start scanning from the bottom of the header towards the top and examine the very first <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">Received:</code></strong> entry. It looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Received: from User (85-250-54-29.bb.netvision.net.il[85.250.54.29])
(authenticated bits=0)
by mail.shako.com.tw (8.14.3/8.14.3/4.90) with ESMTP
 id r0HNXZSI028539; Fri, 18 Jan 2013 07:33:38 +0800
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first email server to receive the email from the sender’s computer creates this entry. If the email client is web-based then this entry will include details about the server hosting the email web application.</p>

<p>Let’s further break down this entry. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">from</code> part of this entry indicates source of the email for this leg of the travel: <code class="highlighter-rouge">User (85-250-54-29.bb.netvision.net.il[85.250.54.29])</code>. You can pick out a Domain Name (<code class="highlighter-rouge">85-250-54-29.bb.netvision.net.il</code>) and an IP address (<code class="highlighter-rouge">85.250.54.29</code>) here.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">by</code> part indicates the first stop taken after email origin:<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mail.shako.com.tw (8.14.3/8.14.3/4.90)</code>. You can pick out a Domain Name here: <code class="highlighter-rouge">mail.shako.com.tw</code>.</p>

<p>The first encountered email server adds this header entry and every other entry below it. There is a high chance that a malicious sender has full control of this email-server. So do not trust this information.<br />
Regardless, we now have some information to do further investigation. Let’s try to figure out where the geographic location of the email-server.</p>

<p>We can use an online utility like http://network-tools.com and enter the domain name or IP address as a query. Here we use <code class="highlighter-rouge">85-250-54-29.bb.netvision.net.il</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mail.shako.com.tw</code> as queries.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
SEARCH RESULTS: 85-250-54-29.bb.netvision.net.il

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The searches reveal that a computer in Israel used an email server in Taiwan as the first stop on its way to the U.S., while the actual body of the email claims the sender is from Guinea Bissau. Something is not right!</p>

<p>There are few other fields that you should investigate in the email header.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Return-Path:</code> See if the email address in this entry matches the email address in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">From:</code> entry. They typically will not match for mass emailers like advertisers or spammers. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Return-Path:</code> email address is used when an email cannot be delivered to its recipients, and it “bounces back”. Spammers don’t want all the undelivered email to end up in their inboxes!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Reply-To:</code> See if the email address in this entry matches the email address in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">From:</code> entry. When you hit reply to an email, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reply-To</code> entry is used to populate the recipients’ email. If it is different, you may accidentally send your reply to someone else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">X-Distribution:</code> if this field’s value is <em>bulk</em>. This indicates bulk/spam email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">X-Mailer:</code> field indicates the email client. If it includes weird names, be suspicious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Bcc:</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">X-UIDL:</code> entries exist. This is a sign of poorly crafted header. They are never in normal emails!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">X-Spam score</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">X-Spam flag</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">X-Spam status</code> entries help determine “spamminess”. But the scores are not standardized across servers so these have to examine on a case by case basis.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Google has an <a href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/">online tool</a> that helps to examine the “hops” and the time delay between them. Large delays in accepting email by the first server may be a sign of overloaded and resource constrained spam servers. Here’s what the tool shows about <a href="../email-headers/email-header1.txt">email-header1.txt</a>. There is a suspicious 12-minute delay right at the beginning, which may indicate an overloaded spam sending email server. Sometimes, the time difference between servers may cause false positives.</p>
